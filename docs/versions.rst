Version Management
==================

This site contains a Docker compatibility table and a change log, including migration instructions.

All Curious Container components (CC-Server, CC-Container-Worker and the CC-Images) have a version tag.
If you are using Curious Containers 0.1 for example, you should use the other components with the exact same version number.
Docker images with a specific version tag can be pulled from a Docker registry and software versions with a certain tag can be pulled from git.
When migrating to a newer CC-Server version, rebuild your custom Docker images with the respective CC-Image.
