## Introduction
**Curious Containers** is an application management service that is able to execute thousands of short-lived applications in a distributed cluster by employing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container engines.

In this context applications are atomic entities taking files and parameters as input and producing new files as output. They are short-lived in a sense that they calculate something and terminate as soon as all results have been produced.

Curious Containers supports scientific use cases like **biomedical analysis** and **reproducible research** by providing standardized methods for packaging applications and executing them in a compute environment. Therefore application dependencies are added to a compatible Docker container image, including all necessary scripts, binaries and configurations.
